## Contributing

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### Finding a bug/creating a feature

If you find a bug and want to fix it, great!! This library can be used in so many ways that there are bound to be things 
in it that don't always work to everyone's needs.
 
Here are some things we think about when we see a bug

- Try to think beyond the immediate problem - These components have many use-cases.
- Start with semantic HTML - This allows the library to work towards the same 'spec' as the website's it will be used on.
- Think about browser compatibility - We like all browsers because then they'll like us!
- Think about accessibility - We love everyone so everyone will like us.

### How to make a clean pull request

Look for a project's contribution instructions. If there are any, follow them.

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github (for now).
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code clearly and try your best to consider using variable.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- The title of your pull request should clearly reference the bug or feature you are resolving.
- Use comments to mark issues as fixed ("`fixes #45`")
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, 
when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
