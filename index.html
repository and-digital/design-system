  <h1>Headers</h1>
  <p>
    Headers can be used in a 'traditional' way and will work perfectly. However, if you choose to use HTML5 sectioning
    (<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>), then you may use helper classes to achieve the same
    look.
  </p>

  <p>
    Helper classes are:

    <code>
      .heading-1
      .heading-2
      .heading-3
      .heading-3-small
    </code>

    and these can be applied to any heading.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>heading 4</h4>
  </section>

<section class="module">
  <h1>Type</h1>

  <h2>Paragraghs</h2>
  <p>A paragraph of text.</p>
  <p>Another paragraph of text.</p>

  <h2>Blockquote</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <q>Something someone said</q>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Small</h2>
  <small>small text</small>
  <p>
    Small text can also be achieved with the class
    <code>.text-small</code>
  </p>

  <h2>lead text</h2>
  <p>
    Lead text can be achieved with the class
    <code>text-lead</code>
  </p>

  <span class="text-lead">Lead text</span>
